After mongo start, input data into productCollection and userCollection.

db.productCollection.insert({name: 'iPhone 12', 'category': 'Phones', 'price': 8000, manufacturer: 'Apple Inc.', 'productImage': 'images/iPhone12.jpg', 'description': 'Most advanced dualâ€‘camera system ever.'})
db.userCollection.insert({'username': 'leo', 'password': '123', 'cart':[], 'totalnum': 0})
